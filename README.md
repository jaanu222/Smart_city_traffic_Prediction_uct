# Smart City Traffic Forecasting ðŸš¦

This is my second project for the UCT internship under the Smart City domain.

## Problem Statement
Government bodies aim to improve city infrastructure by forecasting traffic patterns at four junctions during different seasons and occasions.

##  Dataset
- Timestamped traffic data across multiple months
- Special events and holidays affecting traffic
- Source: UCT internship dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- Prophet (for forecasting)
- Matplotlib

##  Implementation Steps
- Preprocessed and analyzed daily traffic flow
- Visualized traffic trends across junctions
- Applied Prophet time series model to forecast future traffic
- Validated accuracy of predictions

## Results
Forecasted traffic helped identify peak congestion times and supported future urban planning.

## Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in time series forecasting
- Learned to use real-world smart city data
- Built data visualizations and interpreted seasonal patterns

##  Company: UCT
